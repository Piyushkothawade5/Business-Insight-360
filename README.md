# Business Insight 360: Driving Data-Driven Decisions for AtliQ with Power BI

## Overview

Welcome to the **Business Insight 360** project! This comprehensive Power BI dashboard solution was developed to provide a holistic, 360-degree view of business operations across key departments: Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain. My journey in creating this project stems from my BBA in International Business, where I recognized the profound impact data analytics can have on global business strategy. This endeavor, powered by my learning at CodeBasics, showcases my ability to transform complex raw data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ, like many businesses, struggled with scattered data and a lack of integrated insights across its departments. This fragmented view led to reactive decision-making and, in past instances, resulted in significant financial setbacks, such as preventable losses in the LATAM market due to poor forecasting and unoptimized operations. The core challenge was to build a unified analytical platform that could not only present data but also highlight critical trends and prevent costly mistakes.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of the "Business Insight 360" dashboard is to empower AtliQ with a singular, comprehensive platform that provides:
* Integrated Business Metrics: A unified view of KPIs across all critical functions.
* Proactive Decision-Making: Enable leadership to identify trends, opportunities, and risks early.
* Cost Avoidance: Prevent financial losses and operational inefficiencies by addressing historical challenges (e.g., LATAM losses).
* Competitive Edge: Foster a data-driven culture, allowing AtliQ to compete effectively with agile, data-savvy rivals.

## Key Dashboard Modules & Insights

The "Business Insight 360" solution is structured into several interconnected, intuitive dashboards:

* **1. Finance View:**
    * Focus: In-depth analysis of Profit & Loss (P&L) statements, detailed product profitability, and comprehensive net sales trends.
    * Value: Provides financial stakeholders with clear visibility into fiscal health, revenue drivers, and areas for cost optimization.
* **2. Sales View:**
    * Focus: Granular insights into customer behavior and product performance, supported by dynamic charts and filters.
    * Value: Equips sales teams with the intelligence to identify top customers, best-performing products, and optimize sales strategies across regions.
* **3. Marketing View:**
    * Focus: Evaluation of marketing efforts through product and regional performance metrics, linking promotional spend to outcomes.
    * Value: Helps marketing teams understand campaign effectiveness, allocate resources efficiently, and maximize ROI.
* **4. Supply Chain View:**
    * Focus: Critical analysis of forecast accuracy, identifying net error metrics, and monitoring inventory health.
    * Value: Enables supply chain managers to streamline operations, reduce inventory holding costs, and mitigate risks like stock-outs or overstocking.
* **5. Executive View:**
    * Focus: A high-level, executive summary dashboard featuring key performance indicators (KPIs) and aggregated revenue breakdowns.
    * Value: Provides leadership with a concise, actionable overview of the business's overall health for strategic decision-making.

## Technical Stack

The development of this project leveraged the following tools and technologies:

* **Power BI Desktop:** For comprehensive data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard development.
* **MySQL:** Used as the backend database for storing and querying the raw business data.
* **Excel:** Employed for initial data cleaning, manipulation, and supplementary analysis during the project's early phases.

## Key Skills Applied

This project allowed me to apply and enhance a wide range of analytical and technical skills:

* End-to-End Data Modeling & DAX: Designed robust data models and crafted complex DAX expressions for advanced calculations and performance metrics.
* Visualization & Dashboard Storytelling: Created compelling and intuitive data visualizations that effectively convey complex insights to diverse business stakeholders.
* Stakeholder-Focused Insights: Translated core business objectives into actionable dashboard designs, ensuring direct relevance and utility for decision-makers.
* Multi-Source Data Integration: Seamlessly connected, transformed, and integrated data from various sources (e.g., CSV, MySQL) into a unified Power BI model.
* Problem-Solving & Business Acumen: Utilized my BBA IB background to identify core business problems and design analytical solutions that directly address them.
